# Modular Arithmetic and Extended GCD Library

This repository contains a C++ library for performing modular arithmetic operations, including modular exponentiation and calculating modular inverses, with an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The library leverages the Boost Multiprecision library for handling large integers.

---

## Features

- Modular arithmetic operations:
  - Modular addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation.
  - Modular inverse computation.
- Implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
- Handles both positive and negative integers in modular arithmetic.
- Supports arbitrarily large integers using `boost::multiprecision::cpp_int`.
- Comprehensive unit tests written using Google Test.

## Usage

### Example: Modular Exponentiation

```cpp
#include "Utilities.h"
#include <boost/multiprecision/cpp_int.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    using namespace Crypto;
    namespace mp = boost::multiprecision;

    mp::cpp_int base = 3;
    mp::cpp_int power = 5;
    mp::cpp_int mod = 7;

    mp::cpp_int result = Utilities::modularExponentiation(base, power, mod);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl; // Output: 5

    return 0;
}
```

---

## Testing

Unit tests are implemented using **Google Test**. To run the tests:
```bash
cd build
ctest
```

Ensure that the `GTest` dependency is correctly installed or included in the project.
